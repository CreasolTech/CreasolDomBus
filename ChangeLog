ChangeLog

0.0.2 2019-11-12
New feature: for every connected device, every 5 minutes (PERIODIC_STATUS_INTERVAL defined in
CreasolDomBusProtocol.py) Domoticz will transmit the status of those outputs.
This refresh is needed in case a DomBus device has been disconnected from
power supply, or in case of errors on the serial bus.

New feature: automatically remove from the list of known modules ones that do
not transmit since 15 minutes

0.0.1 First version
