# Prerequisites

* Python version 3.9.1 or later

* plugin files should be contained in the directory *DOMOTICZDIR/plugins/CreasolDomBus* 

* Domoticz 2023/2 or later, in case that DomBusEVSE (electric vehicle charging system) is used

# Introduction

*DomBus* is a family of electronic **modules for Domoticz**, designed and produced by Creasol, an italian company.

*DomBus* modules are designed to be **user friendly and minimize power consumption**, and can be used to **expand inputs, outputs and sensors for your Smart Home / Building**. 

One or more devices can be attached to a RS485 serial bus, so with a 4 wire cables (a twisted pair for data and 2 wires for 5-24V power supply) it's possible to connect multiple devices interconnecting the whole building.
As the bus carry both data and power supply, **using a 12Vdc power supply with backup battery it's possible to get home automation system working even in case of blackout / power outage**.

In this folder you can find the python plugin for Domoticz: **you can install the hardware plugin by using Python Plugin Manager, or typing the following commands from the linux shell**:

```
#install git, if not already installed
which git
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then sudo apt install git; fi

#change to the domoticz directory / plugins
cd /home/pi/domoticz/plugins 

#fetch the Python Plugin Manager (that can be used to install/upgrade other plugins, including Creasol DomBus)
git clone https://github.com/ycahome/pp-manager

#install python modules: you can use apt (Debian Linux) or pip3 
pip3 install requests

#fetch Creasol Plugin
git clone https://github.com/CreasolTech/CreasolDomBus

#restart Domoticz daemon
service domoticz restart
```


In case of Windows operating system, please follow the installation instructions at https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Using_Python_plugins#Installing_Python_for_Windows and please note that Domoticz should be restarted to include new python plugins that have been installed.

Then you can find the Creasol DomBus protocol in the **Setup -> Hardware panel**:

**specify a name** (for example, dombus), select **Type Creasol DomBus** and **enter the serial device** used for RS485 bus.

Now you're ready to connect one *DomBus* device to the RS485 bus, and check the new I/Os in the Switches panel or Setup -> Devices menu.

## Creasol DomBus modules

Below a list of modules, produced in Europe by Creasol, designed for Domoticz to be reliable and optimized for very very low power consumption.

[<img src="https://www.creasol.it/youtube.png" alt="Video"/> Download the PDF catalog!](https://www.creasol.it/catalog)

Our industrial and home automation modules are designed to be
* very low power (**around 10mW with relays OFF**)
* reliable (**no disconnections**)
* bus connected (**no radiofrequency interference, no battery to replace**).

Modules are available in two version:
1. with **DomBus proprietary protocol**, working with [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com) only
2. with **Modbus standard protocol**, working with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org), [Node-RED](https://nodered.org)

### DomBusEVSE - EVSE module to build a Smart Wallbox / EV charging station
<a href="https://store.creasol.it/DomBusEVSE"><img src="https://images.creasol.it/creDomBusEVSE_200.png" alt="DomBusEVSE smart EVSE module to make a Smart Wallbox EV Charging station" style="float: left; margin-right: 2em;" align="left" /></a>
Complete solution to make a Smart EVSE, **charging the electric vehicle using only energy from renewable source (photovoltaic, wind, ...), or adding 25-50-75-100% of available power from the grid**.

* Single-phase and three-phases, up to 32A (8kW or 22kW)
* Needs external contactor, RCCB (protection) and EV cable
* Optional power meter to measure charging power, energy, voltage and power factor
* Optional power meter to measure the power usage from the grid (not needed if already exists)
* **Two max grid power thresholds** can be programmed: for example, in Italy who have 6kW contractual power can drain from the grid Max (6* 1.27)=7.6kW for max 90 minutes followed by (6* 1.1)=6.6kW for another 90 minutes. **The module can use ALL available power** when programmed to charge at 100%.
* **Works without the domotic controller** (stand-alone mode), and **can also work with charging current set by the domotic controller (managed mode)**
