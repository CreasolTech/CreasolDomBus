ChangeLog

1.1.6 2022-12-11
Added a cmd checksum for HWADDR command, because new DomBus modules 02h1 needs
	an extra byte with an additional check
BugFix: when configuring a device as FUNCTION=3950 , dombus port was not
	configured properly

1.1.5 2022-12-03
BugFix on ACK transmission for power+energy frames

1.1.4 2022-11-xx
DB34: added support to DCMD on power

1.1.3 2022-10-29
DBEVSE: added the possibility to work without any energy meter connected to
DBEVSE, but using a energy meter connected to the grid and a silly script that
send the current power to the virtual device "Grid Power"

1.1.2 2022-10-27
Added support to NTC 10k 3950 temperature sensors: can be connected to 
any inputs that can be used as IN_TWINBUTTON (with 10k internal pullup
enabled); the device connected to the NTC thermistor should be configured in
this way:  IN_ANALOG,FUNCTION=3950,B=0  where B is an offset that will be
added to the temperature value to compensate a temperature error.

1.1.1 2022-10-11
Naming was changed from "[devID] - Port Name" to "(devID) - Port Name"

1.1.0 2022-09-29
Added support for the new version of DomBusEVSE (charging station for electric vehicles)
Added support for MODBUS energy meters
Improved communication: limited length of ACK frames (only port and
	subcmd/arg1 in the payload); also, ACK are transmitted before CMD.

1.0.5 2021-10-25
Added another management for IN_COUNTER ports: now DomBus ports configured as
IN_COUNTER transmit two 16bit variables:  counterNew and counterOld
where counterOld is the last incremental counter confirmed by Domoticz (with
ACK) and counterNew the current value of counter (counterOld + new_pulses).
In this way counting is always correct, even if Domoticz is down for a short
time.

1.0.2 2021-03-29
Added information about the module name and firmware version for each new
module powered-on (firmware 02b0 or above)

When a port was enabled (DISABLE=2:3:4:5) and now it gets enabled again
(DISABLE=3:4:5), after 60s a new configuration request is issued and port 2
(in this example) will be enabled again, and available in the
Switches/Temperature/Utility/Weather panel.

1.0.1 2021-03-16
New logging function Log(level,msg) to send on log only the required messages
(log verbosity set by Hardware parameter)

Added devID variable for each device, to identify it quickly. devId=hwaddr.port, for
example 103.1 for port 1 of device addr 0x0103. devID written on description
with tag ID, e.g. ID=103.1

Added DCMD command on description, to set a device command (command sent to
another device), e.g.
DCMD(Pulse)=103.1:TOGGLE    -- a short pulse on this input toggle the port 3 of device 0x0103
DCMD(Pulse1)=103.2:ON:30m   -- a 1s pulse on this input turns ON port 2 of device 0x0103 for 30 minutes
DCMD(Pulse2)=103.2:OFF    	-- a 2s pulse on this input turns OFF port 2 of device 0x0103

Added CMD_DCMD_CONFIG command to configure DCMD[0..3] for each port
CMD_DCMD_CONFIG|cmdLen/4|0, port, inCmd|(0..3<<5), inValueL[2], inValueH[2], outAddr[2], outPort, outCmd, outValue[2]

Added timeout management: if a module doesn't send anything for more than 15
minutes, all devices for that module will be displayed with a red header
(TimedOut)

Added IN_COUNTER type, to manage incremental counters and kWh with power
calculation

0.0.4 2020-12-03
BugFix: every 1 minute dombus plugin refreshes the output status, but 
there was bug in refreshing dimmer status. Thanks to Giorgio for the support!

BugFix: dimmer status was not saved in Domoticz, so changing panel and
returning to the dimmer device get to a bad dimmer value. 
Also, now it's possible to turn off dimmer device by clicking on icon
Thanks to Giorgio for let me know this problem!

0.0.3 2020-08-17
New features:
* Temperature, Humidity and Temp+Hum sensors, implemented in Creasol DomBus2
device: ENV_TEMPERATURE, ENV_HUMIDITY, ENV_TEMP_HUM in device notes.
* Added OUT_LEDSTATUS to configure a led as RS485 TX status, instead of
OUT_DIGITAL 
* Added OUT_DIMMER, to generate a 500Hz output, 20 steps: 0, 5%, 10%, ...

0.0.2 2019-11-12
New feature: for every connected device, every 5 minutes (PERIODIC_STATUS_INTERVAL defined in
CreasolDomBusProtocol.py) Domoticz will transmit the status of those outputs.
This refresh is needed in case a DomBus device has been disconnected from
power supply, or in case of errors on the serial bus.

New feature: automatically remove from the list of known modules ones that do
not transmit since 15 minutes

0.0.1 First version
