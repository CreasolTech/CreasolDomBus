Cannot change HWADDR with old modules using protocol=1 (with 0.0.5 it works) 

Creasol DomBus ChangeLog

1.3.10 2025-06-05
	DomBusEVSE: new setpoint device EVMINVOLTAGE used to set the minimum
	voltage to start charging, and voltage to keep during charging.
	Useful when the EV battery is used to prevent overvoltages (with solar
	inverter derating or shutdown), by charging the minimum current needed
	to keep voltage below the overvoltage limit.
	For example, set EVMINVOLTAGE to 248V for single phase or 430V for
	threephase when EV SoC is almost full.
	Set EVMINVOLTAGE to 207 o 380V to charge EV battery faster.

	To use EVMINVOLTAGE feature, old versions of DomBusEVSE must be factory-upgraded
	(free service, only shipping should be paid).
	When the new version of DomBusEVSE is connected, use the following
	procedure to create the new EVMINVOLTAGE device:
	* upgrade Creasol DomBus plugin to the latest version
	* open EV Mode device, using Edit button, and copy (in the clipboard) the configuration
	  (device description)
	* delete the EV Mode device by clicking on Delete button
	* push buttons UP and DOWN on DomBusEVSE, to transmit current EV Mode
	  status to Domoticz => both EV Mode and EV MinVoltage devices will be created
	* add the EV Mode and EV MinVoltage devices to the roomplans, if needed
	* open the EV Mode device from the Switches panel (click on Edit button)
	  and restore the configuration (paste on the Description textarea)



1.3.9 2024-12-01
	DomBusEVSE: now default EVMAXPOWER value is set to 6000 instead of 3300

	kWh meters: when using meters with pulsed output, in case of no pulse the
	plugin compute the power decay. After 1 hour without pulses, power now is
	set to 0.
	Also, domoticz device is still updated even if power=0.

1.3.8 2024-07-09
	Added PULSE3 and PULSEUP3 keywords for DCMD command (execute a command
	when the button is pushed for 3-3.9 seconds. Useful with DomBusTH that now
	transmit a short white flash every second, while the button is pushed, to
	distinguish PULSE1, PULSE2, PULSE3, PULSE4.
	PULSEUP3 is the keyword for twinbutton UP (double button UP/DOWN connected
	to a single I/O, with external 4k7 resistor).

	If Debug level is Verbose or Debug, now any DCMD command is logged (both
	DCMD commands to the controller, to activate a scene/group, and DCMD
	commands to other DomBus devices in the same bus).

1.3.7 2024-06-16 Requires Domoticz Beta 2023/2 dd18-9-2023 or next
	EVSE: added a virtual device "EV MaxCurrent" (TypeName=Setpoint) associated to the EVMAXCURRENT 
	parameter that permits to set the maximum charging current easily.
	This parameter is useful during the Summer when Grid Voltage is very high
	and lead to solar inverter power limiting.
	To avoid this trouble, it's possible to charge the vehicle in Solar mode, 
	to use only solar energy, setting a small current (for example 12A in
	single phase, or 6A in three phase), just to reduce the inverter voltage
	preventing inverter power limiting and also prevening EV battery charging
	too quickly when the State-of-Charge is high.
	
	For system where the EVSE module is already active, to get the new EV
	Maxcurrent device created, 
	1. update the Creasol DomBus plugin 
	2. Setup -> Hardware, select DomBus plugin, and click on Update
	3. Enter Switches panel, select "EV Mode" device, save the description
	   text in the clipboard (or file), click on Delete button to remove it
	4. Press the UP and DOWN button on the DomBusEVSE module 

	The EV Maxcurent can be updated manually, or by a script (for example
	a Lua script that checks for battery SoC, and if it's low sets the
	EV MaxCurrent to 16 or 32A, while if SoC is high (battery almost full) 
	sets EV MaxCurrent to a lower value.
	Lua example: set MaxCurrent to 12A
	commandArray[#commandArray+1]={['UpdateDevice']=tostring(otherdevices_idx['dombus - (ffe3.104) EV MaxCurrent'])..'|1|12'}

1.3.6 2024-02-29
	Added option EV3PSELECT, for DomBusEVSE module on device RL2, to permit 
	1P or 3P EV charging using 2x contactors (2P 40A) connected to RLEV and
	RL2.
	Connection: Line----- RL EV --+-- RL2 --+
	                              C         C      Contactor 1 and
								  1         2      contactor 2 coils
	            Neutral-----------+---------+                  
	If RL2 is configured as EV3PSELECT, it's possible to 
	1. stop charging (EVMode=Off)
	2. enable RL2 device
	3. start charging (EVMode=Solar or 25% or more) to activate both
		contactors enabling three-phase charging.

	1. stop charging (EVMode=Off)
	2. disable RL2 device
	3. start charging (EVMode=Solar or 25% or more) to activate only
		the contactor driven by RL EV, enabling single-phase charging.
	


1.3.5 2024-01-11
	Counter management: fixed the case that value2!=counterOld but
	value-counterOld is consistent.

1.3.4 2023-11-28
	Added parameter EVMETERTYPE=
	  0 => DDS238 ZN/S energy meter (single phase)
	  1 => DTS238 ZN/S energy meter (three phases) 
	On DomBusEVSE EVMETERTYPE should be set to 1 in case of three-phase
	electric power, even if no energy meter is directly connected to the EVSE
	module.

	Some fixes on changing device configuration (protocol)

1.3.3 2023-07-04
	Temperature: when Options['avgTemp'] is changed, d.Update(Options)

1.3.2 2023-07-04
	Using float constants instead of integer to compute the NTC temperature.

1.3.1 2023-06-05
	Added Rain type: "IN_COUNTER,Typename=Rain"

1.3.0 2023-05-28
	Added PULLUP and PULLDOWN options. They don't work with CUSTOM devices.

	Changed management of incremental counters (sValue should be set to the
	increment value, then Domoticz will update the cumulated value by itsself)
	
1.2.2 2023-04-06
	Improved decode routine to reduce latency in case of bad data received

1.2.1 2023-02-13
	NTC 10k temperature: limit precision to 1 digit even when using B
	coefficient. Also computed and sent the average value. (TonyA)


1.2.0 2023-01-18
DCMD: added the possibility to trigger a scene or group
	DCMD(Pulse)=0.e:Toggle	toggle a group with idx=14 (14=0x0e in hex
							format) when a pulse 0.5s is received
							For example turn on/off a group of lights

	DCMD(Pulse1)=0.f:Off	deactivate a group with idx=15 (f=15) when 
	                        a pulse 1s is received
							For example turn off a group of lights
	DCDM(Pulse2)=0.10:On	activate a scene/group when a long pulse (2s) is
							received
							For example activate a scene to switch off all
							lights, loads and heaters when leaving the house

EVSE: 
	Changed parameters MAXPOWER to EVMAXPOWER, MAXCURRENT to EVMAXCURRENT...
	Added parameter EVWAITTIME : Time to wait, in seconds, before changing 
	  EV current again. This parameter depends by how fast is the on board
	  charger to modify the EV charging current. SAE J1772 specifies that OBD
	  shoud adapt charging current within 6 seconds.

1.1.8 2022-12-29
EVSE: added parameters MaxPowerTime, MaxPower2, MaxPower2Time to get a smart
charging session at the maximum power supported by the electricity meter:

MaxPower2 (e.g. 7600 Watt)                      ####################
MaxPower  (e.g. 6600 Watt)  ##################################################
Time                        start               90min              180min

MaxPower2 must be > MaxPower
MaxPowerTime and MaxPower2Time must be in the range 60-43200 seconds

1.1.7 2022-12-13
Ventian Blind device: since 2022.2 version, commands now are Stop, Close, Open
	instead of Stop, On, Off. This version works with older and newer
	version of Domoticz.

1.1.6 2022-12-11
Added a cmd checksum for HWADDR command, because new DomBus modules 02h1 needs
	an extra byte with an additional check
BugFix: when configuring a device as FUNCTION=3950 , dombus port was not
	configured properly

1.1.5 2022-12-03
BugFix on ACK transmission for power+energy frames

1.1.4 2022-11-xx
DB34: added support to DCMD on power

1.1.3 2022-10-29
DBEVSE: added the possibility to work without any energy meter connected to
DBEVSE, but using a energy meter connected to the grid and a silly script that
send the current power to the virtual device "Grid Power"

1.1.2 2022-10-27
Added support to NTC 10k 3950 temperature sensors: can be connected to 
any inputs that can be used as IN_TWINBUTTON (with 10k internal pullup
enabled); the device connected to the NTC thermistor should be configured in
this way:  IN_ANALOG,FUNCTION=3950,B=0  where B is an offset that will be
added to the temperature value to compensate a temperature error.

1.1.1 2022-10-11
Naming was changed from "[devID] - Port Name" to "(devID) - Port Name"

1.1.0 2022-09-29
Added support for the new version of DomBusEVSE (charging station for electric vehicles)
Added support for MODBUS energy meters
Improved communication: limited length of ACK frames (only port and
	subcmd/arg1 in the payload); also, ACK are transmitted before CMD.

1.0.5 2021-10-25
Added another management for IN_COUNTER ports: now DomBus ports configured as
IN_COUNTER transmit two 16bit variables:  counterNew and counterOld
where counterOld is the last incremental counter confirmed by Domoticz (with
ACK) and counterNew the current value of counter (counterOld + new_pulses).
In this way counting is always correct, even if Domoticz is down for a short
time.

1.0.2 2021-03-29
Added information about the module name and firmware version for each new
module powered-on (firmware 02b0 or above)

When a port was enabled (DISABLE=2:3:4:5) and now it gets enabled again
(DISABLE=3:4:5), after 60s a new configuration request is issued and port 2
(in this example) will be enabled again, and available in the
Switches/Temperature/Utility/Weather panel.

1.0.1 2021-03-16
New logging function Log(level,msg) to send on log only the required messages
(log verbosity set by Hardware parameter)

Added devID variable for each device, to identify it quickly. devId=hwaddr.port, for
example 103.1 for port 1 of device addr 0x0103. devID written on description
with tag ID, e.g. ID=103.1

Added DCMD command on description, to set a device command (command sent to
another device), e.g.
DCMD(Pulse)=103.1:TOGGLE    -- a short pulse on this input toggle the port 3 of device 0x0103
DCMD(Pulse1)=103.2:ON:30m   -- a 1s pulse on this input turns ON port 2 of device 0x0103 for 30 minutes
DCMD(Pulse2)=103.2:OFF    	-- a 2s pulse on this input turns OFF port 2 of device 0x0103

Added CMD_DCMD_CONFIG command to configure DCMD[0..3] for each port
CMD_DCMD_CONFIG|cmdLen/4|0, port, inCmd|(0..3<<5), inValueL[2], inValueH[2], outAddr[2], outPort, outCmd, outValue[2]

Added timeout management: if a module doesn't send anything for more than 15
minutes, all devices for that module will be displayed with a red header
(TimedOut)

Added IN_COUNTER type, to manage incremental counters and kWh with power
calculation

0.0.4 2020-12-03
BugFix: every 1 minute dombus plugin refreshes the output status, but 
there was bug in refreshing dimmer status. Thanks to Giorgio for the support!

BugFix: dimmer status was not saved in Domoticz, so changing panel and
returning to the dimmer device get to a bad dimmer value. 
Also, now it's possible to turn off dimmer device by clicking on icon
Thanks to Giorgio for let me know this problem!

0.0.3 2020-08-17
New features:
* Temperature, Humidity and Temp+Hum sensors, implemented in Creasol DomBus2
device: ENV_TEMPERATURE, ENV_HUMIDITY, ENV_TEMP_HUM in device notes.
* Added OUT_LEDSTATUS to configure a led as RS485 TX status, instead of
OUT_DIGITAL 
* Added OUT_DIMMER, to generate a 500Hz output, 20 steps: 0, 5%, 10%, ...

0.0.2 2019-11-12
New feature: for every connected device, every 5 minutes (PERIODIC_STATUS_INTERVAL defined in
CreasolDomBusProtocol.py) Domoticz will transmit the status of those outputs.
This refresh is needed in case a DomBus device has been disconnected from
power supply, or in case of errors on the serial bus.

New feature: automatically remove from the list of known modules ones that do
not transmit since 15 minutes

0.0.1 First version
