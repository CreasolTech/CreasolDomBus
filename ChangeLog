ChangeLog
0.0.5 2020-12-
New logging function Log(level,msg) to send on log only the required messages
(log verbosity set by Hardware parameter)

Added devID variable for each device, to identify it quickly. devId=hwaddr.port, for
example 103.1 for port 1 of device addr 0x0103. devID written on description
with tag ID, e.g. ID=103.1

Added DCMD command on description, to set a device command (command sent to
another device), e.g.
DCMD(Pulse)=103.1:TOGGLE    -- a short pulse on this input toggle the port 3 of device 0x0103
DCMD(Pulse1)=103.2:ON:30m   -- a 1s pulse on this input turns ON port 2 of device 0x0103 for 30 minutes
DCMD(Pulse2)=103.2:OFF    	-- a 2s pulse on this input turns OFF port 2 of device 0x0103

Added CMD_DCMD_CONFIG command to configure DCMD[0..3] for each port
CMD_DCMD_CONFIG|cmdLen/4|0, port, inCmd|(0..3<<5), inValueL[2], inValueH[2], outAddr[2], outPort, outCmd, outValue[2]

BugFix: every 1 minute dombus plugin refreshes the output status, but 
there was bug in refreshing dimmer status. Thanks to Giorgio for the support!

BugFix: dimmer status was not saved in Domoticz, so changing panel and
returning to the dimmer device get to a bad dimmer value. 
Also, now it's possible to turn off dimmer device by clicking on icon
Thanks to Giorgio for let me know this problem!

0.0.3 2020-08-17
New features:
* Temperature, Humidity and Temp+Hum sensors, implemented in Creasol DomBus2
device: ENV_TEMPERATURE, ENV_HUMIDITY, ENV_TEMP_HUM in device notes.
* Added OUT_LEDSTATUS to configure a led as RS485 TX status, instead of
OUT_DIGITAL 
* Added OUT_DIMMER, to generate a 500Hz output, 20 steps: 0, 5%, 10%, ...

0.0.2 2019-11-12
New feature: for every connected device, every 5 minutes (PERIODIC_STATUS_INTERVAL defined in
CreasolDomBusProtocol.py) Domoticz will transmit the status of those outputs.
This refresh is needed in case a DomBus device has been disconnected from
power supply, or in case of errors on the serial bus.

New feature: automatically remove from the list of known modules ones that do
not transmit since 15 minutes
